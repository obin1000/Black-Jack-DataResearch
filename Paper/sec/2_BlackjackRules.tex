\section{The rules of Blackjack}
To understand this paper, it is important to understand the rules of Blackjack. This paper and the code to generate and refine the data is based around the most common rules used in casinos. \\
Blackjack is a card game which is played in casinos all around the world. It is an one versus one game with two players, the dealer and the player. The dealer deals the cards and the player decides what moves he wants to do. \\
 \\
The goal is for the player to have a higher card value than the dealer, without going over the value of 21. \\ 
The values of the cards are as followed: \\
Ace : 11 or 1 points \\
King, Queen, Jack : 10 points \\
2 to 10 : Its card value \\
 \\
The game starts with the dealer giving himself one card and the player two cards. All cards are open in Blackjack. The player has now two choices: He can either pass or draw. When the player draws he gets an extra card and gets to choose again. When the player passes, it is the turn of the dealer. The dealer draws cards until he has at least a value of 17 in his hand. After the dealer is done drawing cards, the value of the dealer is compared to the value of the player. The highest value wins, however if either value goes over 21, it automatically results in a lose for that side. An exact value of 21 results in an automatic win.
