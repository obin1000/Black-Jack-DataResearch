\section{Introduction}
For experienced Blackjack players it won't be difficult to make the correct move with most hands of cards. \\
 \\
For example when the player gets 18, 19 or 20 in his starting hand, the player will always pass. If the player chooses to draw a card, the probability is very high he will lose. \\
Another example, when the player gets 9, 10 or 11 in his hand, he will always at least draw one extra card. This is because the player can\textquotesingle t go over 21 with 1 more card and the probability of winning with this starting hand is very low. \\
However when the player gets 14, 15 or 16 in his hand, things get more difficult. One more card can be fatal, but not drawing a card has a big probability of losing from the dealer. \\
 \\
This paper will discuss what the best move is with these difficult hands. The way this is tested is by playing many games of Blackjack and writing down the results. The result with the most wins, wins! However to be able to get a reliable result, we will need a lot of data. A few games will not give a reliable reflection of the probability of the game, because it could be coincidence. With coincidence is meant, when four games are played and all four are won by the player, this is coincidence. It is not a good reflection of the reality, but a result of random factor. In the case of Blackjack is the random factor the cards which are randomly shuffles. No matter how big the data set gets, we will always keep a coincidence. The probability will always exists that the player or dealer wins more games in the test than he will in reality. However this probability can be made smaller and smaller by expanding the dataset. This is why the experiment is done with a simulation of Blackjack in the programming language Python. With the power of computers, thousands of games of Blackjack can be played each second! With this approach is expected that it will minimize the coincidence and the results will be reliable. \\
With all the results of the games it is possible to extract the decisions the player made combined with how many times the player won and lost, resulting in which move gives the highest probability to win. \\
 \\
Another thing that will be looked at is the total wins of the dealer and the total wins of the player and the ratio between these. Expected is that, with the normal Blackjack rules used in the casino, the dealer will have a higher number of wins. If this is not the case, it wouldn't make sense for casinos to play this game. They would only be losing money in the long run! \\
